        <p1> <br> Welcome to my website! </br> </p1>
        <p1> <br>  My name is Daniel Chisner and I am a communications officer with the United States Marine Corps. My job as a communication officer is similar to a solutions architect and cybersecurity intelligence analyst in the private sector. Since joining the Marine Corps, I have led hundreds of Marines, planned and established global communications, and innovated Marine Corps cybersecurity. On several occasions, I have managed teams of 10 to 500 service members in the establishment of Cisco, Microsoft Active Directory, and VMware infrastructures, enabling global communications for tens of thousands of users. I also created the first information intelligence center for Marine Corps aviation, which assesses and blocks cyber, electromagnetic spectrum, and space threats. Additionally, I recently wrote the Marine Corps&#39 procedures for integrated planning and execution of offensive and defensive cyber, psychological, intelligence, public affairs, and communications operations. </br></p1>
        <p1> <br> I hope you enjoy your time on my website and please do not hesitate to reach out via the email or phone number on my resume. Thank you! </br></p1>
